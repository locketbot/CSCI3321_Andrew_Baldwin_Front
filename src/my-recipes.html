<img src="https://thestayathomechef.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Pot-Roast-1.jpg" width="250" height="300" alt="Roast Recipe">
<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Salt and pepper</li>
  <li>One 3-5 pound chuck roast</li>
  <li>2 or 3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
  <li>2 whole onions, peeled</li>
  <li>6-8 carrots</li>
  <li>3 cups beef broth</li>
  <li>2 or 3 sprigs rosemary</li>
  <li>2 or 3 sprigs thyme</li>
</ul>
<h4>Directions:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 275 degrees.</li>
  <li>Generously salt and pepper the chuck roast.</li>
  <li>Heat the olive oil in large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.</li>
  <li>Add the halved onions to the pot, browning them on both sides. Remove the onions to a plate.</li>
  <li>Throw the carrots into the same very hot pot and toss them around a bit until slightly browned, about a minute or so. Reserve the carrots with the onions.</li>
  <li>With the burner still on high, use either red wine or beef broth (about 1 cup) to deglaze the pot, scraping the bottom with a whisk. Place the roast back into the pot and add enough beef stock to cover the meat halfway.</li>
  <li>Add in the onions and the carrots, along with the fresh herbs.</li>
  <li>Put the lid on, then roast for 3 hours for a 3-pound roast. For a 4 to 5-pound roast, plan on 4 hours. The roast is ready when it's fall-apart tender.</li>

<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>6 chicken thighs</li>
  <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
  <li>3 Tbsp cornstarch</li>
  <li>2 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
  <li>5 Tbsp rice vinegar</li>
  <li>3 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
  <li>1 Tbsp Sambal Oelek</li>
  <li>2 Tbsp honey</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp sesame oil</li>

</ul>
<h4>Directions:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Heat a skillet on the stovetop over medium high heat.
</li>
  <li>Cut chicken into quite small, bite-sized pieces and place into a large bowl (cutting the pieces small ensure that they cook through quickly). Season with a bit of salt and freshly ground pepper. Sprinkle with cornstarch and toss well to evenly coat all the chicken.</li>
  <li>Add the oil to the hot pan and allow to heat briefly, then add all the chicken to the pan and distribute evenly. Allow to sit undisturbed for about a minute, then toss and allow to sit undisturbed for another minute. Continue cooking, tossing regularly, until chicken is cooked through and evenly golden.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, combine all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl and set aside. </li>
  <li>Pour sauce into skillet and stir to combine. Allow to simmer, tossing occasionally, until sauce thickens and coats the chicken.</li>
</ol>
